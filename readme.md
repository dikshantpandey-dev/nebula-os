## ðŸ”¥ Important: Run on Live Server
Because Nebula OS uses **dynamic iframe loading** (`apps/*.html` inside windows), **opening it directly from your file system (file://)** may cause iframe permissions and path errors.

To fix this, you should run it using a **Live Server** (like VS Codeâ€™s Live Server extension).

### Run on Live Server (Recommended):
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Install and enable the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click on `index.html` â†’ **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. Your Nebula OS will open correctly at:  
   [http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500) or similar.

âœ… This ensures iframe apps, windows, and other scripts work properly without restrictions!
